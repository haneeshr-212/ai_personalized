Problem Definition & Objective
a. Selected Project Track

AI in Personalized Learning

This project is developed under the AI in Personalized Learning track, which focuses on applying artificial intelligence techniques to design adaptive educational systems. The track emphasizes moving beyond traditional one-size-fits-all education by leveraging machine learning and natural language processing to personalize learning experiences according to individual learner behavior, performance, and engagement.

b. Clear Problem Statement

Conventional educational platforms deliver uniform content, pace, and assessments to all learners, regardless of individual differences in learning speed, accuracy, engagement, or prior knowledge. This rigid approach often leads to poor learning outcomes, where struggling learners are overwhelmed and advanced learners remain under-challenged. Additionally, educators lack scalable tools to continuously monitor learner progress and provide timely, personalized feedback.

The problem addressed in this project is the absence of an intelligent, adaptive learning system that can automatically analyze learner interactions and dynamically adjust educational content, difficulty level, pace, and feedback for each learner using AI-driven techniques.

c. Real-World Relevance and Motivation

In real-world educational settings such as schools, online learning platforms, and self-paced digital courses, learner diversity is inevitable. Personalized attention from instructors is limited due to large class sizes and resource constraints. AI-based personalized learning systems offer a scalable solution by continuously tracking learner behavior, identifying learning gaps, and delivering targeted interventions in real time.

Motivated by the need to improve learning outcomes, engagement, and accessibility, this project demonstrates how AI can support both learners and educators by creating adaptive, data-driven learning experiences that respond to individual needs while maintaining educational consistency and fairness.
